Items to note:

  * bungalow-1
    First approximation to the initial bungalow, unzoned AAAA, from DOI 10.3390/su16114710
    As of 20250413-snapshot steady -3C exterior:
        DHD20240413: 'operative' (@0.5) thermostat raises ZONE ONE PURCHASED AIR,Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Heating Rate [W] to 2025W (cf 3825W at 0.89).
        DHD20240413: now 28.35GJ (7876kWh, 900W) annual for Birmingham weather annual simulation.  (Manchester EGCC from paper 875W.)
 
  * bungalow-1-diurnal
    As bungalow-1/20250413-snapshot but with 3C peak-to-peak diurnal temperature swing. 
        DHD20250508: adjusted Daily Temp Range {C} to 3 (and max to -1.5 to approx preserve mean), for similar range to CIBSE Leeds (UK) typical winter day.
        DHD20250508: ext temperature and Zone Ideal Loads Zone Total Heating Rate [W] range from -4.5C to -1.5C and 1993W and 2188W.

  * bungalow-2
     As bungalow-1 but partitioned into 4 rooms/zones.
