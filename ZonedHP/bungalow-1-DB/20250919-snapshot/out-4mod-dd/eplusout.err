   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (2) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: The ZoneComponentLoadSummary report was requested but no sizing objects were found so that report cannot be generated.
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: For a zone sizing run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Zone input object. SimulationControl Zone Sizing option ignored.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Floor Area entered for Zone="BLOCK1:ZONE1" significantly different from calculated Floor Area
   **   ~~~   ** Entered Zone Floor Area value=54.97, Calculated Zone Floor Area value=64.00, entered Floor Area will be used in calculations.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Volume entered for Zone="BLOCK1:ZONE1" significantly different from calculated Volume
   **   ~~~   ** Entered Zone Volume value=104.44, Calculated Zone Volume value=147.20, entered volume will be used in calculations.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
