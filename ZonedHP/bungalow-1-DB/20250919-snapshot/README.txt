Building now has approx correct external dimensions and character (no windows).

Working on moving values in "HeatTransfer Surface" (HTML) table to match paper.

HeatTransfer target U values: floor 0, walls/roof with film 0.61 W/m2K.

Attempting to reduce floor loss to near zero (something like thick aerogel).
U-value has dropped from ~0.25 (with film) to ~0.14
but final heat demand seems more or less unchanged at ~1144W (was ~1146W).

Current floor U value (with film): 0.144 
Current wall U value (with film): 0.351 
Current roof U value (with film): 0.246
