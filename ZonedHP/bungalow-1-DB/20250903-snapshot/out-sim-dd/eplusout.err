   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Floor Area entered for Zone="BLOCK1:ZONE1" significantly different from calculated Floor Area
   **   ~~~   ** Entered Zone Floor Area value=54.97, Calculated Zone Floor Area value=64.00, entered Floor Area will be used in calculations.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Volume entered for Zone="BLOCK1:ZONE1" significantly different from calculated Volume
   **   ~~~   ** Entered Zone Volume value=104.44, Calculated Zone Volume value=147.20, entered volume will be used in calculations.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 5 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** Each Unused construction is shown.

   ** Warning ** Calculated design cooling load for zone=BLOCK1:ZONE1 is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ** Warning ** Calculated partial vapor pressure is greater than the barometric pressure, so that calculated humidity ratio is invalid (PsyWFnTdpPb).
