# BuildingModelsForHeating

Models of building for heating simulations and similar.

This includes models for EnergyPlus(TM).

Models here are in various states of usefulness and polish;
please read the documentation accompanying each.

These models explore optimisation of space heating,
such as with heat pumps and micro-zoning with TRVs,
for a UK / northern European climate in particular.
