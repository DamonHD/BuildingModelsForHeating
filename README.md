# BuildingModelsForHeating
Models of building for heating simulations and similar.

This includes models for EnergyPlus(TM) and/or similar.

These models are intended to explore optimisation of space heating,
such as with heat pumps and microzoning,
for a UK / northern European climate in particular.
